To deploy an instance of a compiled smart contract that has already been installed onto the Stellar network, use the `stellar contract deploy` command:

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
    --source S... \
    --network testnet \
    --wasm-hash <hex-encoded-wasm-hash> \
    --alias <alias>
```

:::tip
Optionally assign an alias by replacing `<alias>` with your desired alias name for the contract. The alias is a locally stored mapping to the contract address, and can be used in other stellar-cli commands in place of the address.
