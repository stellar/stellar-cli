### Install
Recommend installing from one of the supported package managers if you can, as you'll get a precompiled binary. But you can also install from source.
On macOS:
```
brew install stellar-cli
```
On Windows:
```
winget install --id Stellar.StellarCLI
```
On anything else, or if you prefer to build from source:
```
cargo install --locked stellar-cli
```

### Network Config
Network config is supported under the `stellar network` command.
```
stellar network use testnet
```
Testnet is preconfigured, and is what I'm going to use today. You can add config for your RPC for mainnet. Or your RPC for testnet if you want to use your own.

### Assets
#### Creation
To create a Stellar Asset we need a Stellar account created, that'll be the issuer. Assets on Stellar are uniquely defined by a code and an issuer address. So they look like this:
```
stellar keys generate issuer
```

View the public key with:
```
stellar keys public-key issuer
```

Configure the issuer key to be used for signing transactions:
```
stellar keys use issuer
```

#### Issuer Config
```
stellar tx new set-options \
  --set-revocable \
  --set-clawback-enabled
```

If you'd like to look at the tx before sending:
```
stellar tx new set-options \
  --set-revocable \
  --set-clawback-enabled \
  --build-only \
  | stellar tx edit \
  | stellar sign \
  | stellar send
```

#### Choose Asset Code
```
echo ABC:$(stellar keys public-key issuer)
```

#### Contract Deployment
```
stellar contract asset deploy \
  --asset ABC:$(stellar keys public-key issuer) \
  --alias abc-asset
```

Run a few commands to get some read only data from the contract to confirm it's there.
```
stellar contract invoke --id abc-asset -- symbol
stellar contract invoke --id abc-asset -- name
stellar contract invoke --id abc-asset -- decimals
```

#### Admin Setup
At this point the issuer is the admin of the contract.
Let's create another account that'll be the admin.
```
stellar keys generate admin
stellar keys public-key admin
stellar keys use admin
```
```
stellar contract invoke \
  --id abc-asset \
  -- \
  set_admin \
  --new_admin=issuer
```


### Mint
```
stellar keys generate user
stellar keys public-key user
```
```
stellar contract invoke \
  --id abc-asset \
  -- \
  mint \
  --to user \
  --amount 25
```

### Burn
```
stellar keys use user
stellar contract invoke \
  --id abc-asset \
  -- \
  burn \
  --from user
  --amount 25
```

### Freeze (revoke authorisation)
```
stellar keys use admin
stellar contract invoke \
  --id abc-asset \
  -- \
  set_authorized \
  --id user
  --authorize false
```

### Clawback
```
stellar keys use admin
stellar contract invoke \
  --id abc-asset \
  -- \
  clawback \
  --from user
  --amount 25
```
