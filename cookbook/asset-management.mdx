The [stellar-cli] can be used to issue and administer assets on the Stellar network.

### Asset Issuance

To create a Stellar Asset using the [stellar-cli] several steps take place:
- An issuer account must exist.
- An asset code selected.
- Optionally, an admin is configured.


#### Issuer Creation

To create an issuer, generate a key.

```
stellar keys generate issuer
```

View the public key with:

```
stellar keys public-key issuer
```

Configure the issuer key to be used for signing transactions:

```
stellar keys use issuer
```

#### Issuer Config

Issuer accounts have several configuration flags that can be toggled and affect all assets issued by the issuer.

In this guide the issuer accounts revocable and clawback-enabled features will be enabled. These features allow the asset admin to revoke authorisation to use an asset, which has the effect of freezing the asset, and to clawback, which has the effect of forcibly burning the asset.

```
stellar tx new set-options \
  --set-revocable \
  --set-clawback-enabled
```

To see other options, see the manual for the [stellar tx new set-options](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli/stellar-cli#stellar-tx-new-set-options) command.

To view the tx before sending, use the `--build-only` option and pipe the transaction through the tx edit command:
```
stellar tx new set-options \
  --set-revocable \
  --set-clawback-enabled \
  --build-only \
  | stellar tx edit \
  | stellar sign \
  | stellar send
```

#### Choosing the Asset Code

Choose an asset code 1 to 12 characters long.

The asset code along with the issuer account address will uniquely identify the asset. An issuer can issue multiple assets, distinguished by their asset code.

For the rest of this guide the asset code `ABC` will be used.

#### Asset Contract Setup

A built-in contract exists on network for every asset. It's address is reserved and can be calculated using the following command.

```
stellar contract asset id \
  --asset ABC:$(stellar keys public-key issuer)
```

The contract is not deployed automatically. Anyone can deploy the contract, it is not an action requiring authorisation.

##### Contract Deployment

Deploy the built-in asset contract.

The `--asset` option specifies the name of the asset, which is in the format `<asset-code>:<asset-issuer>`.

The `--alias` option stores locally an alias that can be used in subsequent commands to reference the contract address.

```
stellar contract asset deploy \
  --asset ABC:$(stellar keys public-key issuer) \
  --alias abc
```

Run a few commands to get some read only data from the contract to confirm it's deployed.

```
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- symbol
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- name
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- decimals
```

##### Admin Setup
At this point the issuer is the admin of the contract.
Let's create another account that'll be the admin.
```
stellar keys generate admin
stellar keys public-key admin
```
```
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- set_admin --new_admin admin
```

### Actions

See the following examples for how to administer and use the asset.

#### Mint (Admin Only)

Generate and fund a user account.

```
stellar keys generate user
stellar keys public-key user
```

Using the admin account, invoke the asset contract's `mint` function.

```
stellar keys use admin
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- mint --to user --amount 25
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
```

#### Transfer
```
stellar keys generate user2
stellar keys public-key user2
```
```
stellar keys use user
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- transfer --from user --to user2 --amount 3
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user2
```

#### Burn
```
stellar keys use user
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- burn --from user --amount 5
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
```

#### Revoke Authorization / Freeze (Admin Only)
```
stellar keys use admin
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- set_authorized --id user --authorize false
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
```
```
stellar keys generate user2
stellar keys public-key user2
stellar keys use user
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- transfer --from user --to user2 --amount 3
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
```

#### Clawback (Admin Only)
```
stellar keys use admin
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- clawback --from user --amount 25
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
```
