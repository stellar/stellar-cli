The [stellar-cli] can be used to issue and administer assets on the Stellar network.

The following guide assumes that the [stellar-cli] has been configured to use
testnet, or a local test network. To use testnet, run the following command.

```bash
stellar network use testnet
```

### Asset Issuance

To create a Stellar Asset using the [stellar-cli] several steps take place:

- An issuer account must exist.
- An asset code selected.
- Optionally, an admin is configured.

#### Issuer Creation

To create an issuer, generate a key and fund it. Funding uses friendbot, the
testnet faucet, to is only available on testnet.

```bash
stellar keys generate issuer
```

```bash
stellar keys fund issuer
```

View the public key with:

```bash
stellar keys public-key issuer
```

Configure the issuer key to be used for signing transactions:

```bash
stellar keys use issuer
```

#### Issuer Config

Issuer accounts have several configuration flags that can be toggled and affect
all assets issued by the issuer.

In this guide the issuer accounts revocable and clawback-enabled features will
be enabled. These features allow the asset admin to revoke authorisation to use
an asset, which has the effect of freezing the asset, and to clawback, which
has the effect of forcibly burning the asset.

```bash
stellar tx new set-options \
  --set-revocable \
  --set-clawback-enabled
```

To see other options, see the manual for the [stellar tx new set-options] command.

To view the tx before sending, use the `--build-only` option and pipe the
transaction through the tx edit command:

```bash cookbooktest.ignore="because piping isn't supported"
stellar tx new set-options \
  --set-revocable \
  --set-clawback-enabled \
  --build-only \
  | stellar tx edit \
  | stellar sign \
  | stellar send
```

#### Choosing the Asset Code

Choose an asset code 1 to 12 characters long.

The asset code along with the issuer account address will uniquely identify the
asset. An issuer can issue multiple assets, distinguished by their asset code.

For the rest of this guide the asset code `ABC` will be used.

#### Asset Contract Setup

A built-in contract exists on network for every asset. It's address is reserved
and can be calculated using the following command.

```bash
stellar contract asset id --asset ABC:issuer
```

The contract is not deployed automatically. Anyone can deploy the contract, it
is not an action requiring authorisation.

##### Contract Deployment

Deploy the built-in asset contract.

The `--asset` option specifies the name of the asset, which is in the format
`<asset-code>:<asset-issuer>`.

The `--alias` option stores locally an alias that can be used in subsequent
commands to reference the contract address.

```bash
stellar contract asset deploy --asset ABC:issuer --alias abc
```

Run the follownig command to get some read only data from the contract to confirm it's deployed.

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- name
```

##### Admin Setup

At this point the issuer is the admin of the contract.
Let's create another account that'll be the admin.

```bash
stellar keys generate admin
```

```bash
stellar keys public-key admin
```

```bash
stellar keys fund admin
```

Using the issuer account, invoke the asset contract's `set_admin` function.

```bash
stellar keys use issuer
```

```bash
stellar contract invoke --source issuer --id abc -- set_admin --new_admin admin
```

### Actions

Once the asset contract is deployed and setup, the following actions can take place.

#### Mint (Admin Only)

Generate and fund a user account that the minted asset will be transferred to.
Also have the new user trust the asset.

```bash
stellar keys generate user
```

```bash
stellar keys fund user
```

```bash
stellar keys public-key user
```

```bash
stellar keys use user
```

```bash
stellar tx new change-trust --line ABC:issuer
```

Using the admin account, invoke the asset contract's `mint` function.

```bash
stellar keys use admin
```

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- mint --to user --amount 25
```

Check the balance after the mint.

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
```

#### Transfer

Generate and fund a second user account that the user account from the previous
step can transfer the asset to.

```bash
stellar keys generate user2
```

```bash
stellar keys fund user2
```

```bash
stellar keys public-key user2
```

```bash
stellar keys use user2
```

```bash
stellar tx new change-trust --line ABC:issuer
```

Using the user account, invoke the asset contract's `transfer` function.

```bash
stellar keys use user
```

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- transfer --from user --to user2 --amount 3
```

Check the balances after the transfer.

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
```

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user2
```

#### Burn

Using the user account, invoke the asset contract's `burn` function.

```bash
stellar keys use user
```

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- burn --from user --amount 5
```

Check the balance after the burn.

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
```

#### Revoke Authorization / Freeze (Admin Only)

An admin can revoke a user's authorisation to use the asset. The user will
continue to hold the balance but will be unable to transfer it or create new
payments. Any existing liabilities, such as those created by offers created on
Stellar, will continue to exist and could still be executed.

Using the admin, invoke the asset contract's `set_authorized` function.

```bash
stellar keys use admin
```

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- set_authorized --id user --authorize false
```

Using the user account, invoke the asset contract's `transfer` function. The
invocation will fail because they are no longer authorized to transfer.

```bash
stellar keys use user
```

```bash cookbooktest.fail cookbooktest.stderr="balance is deauthorized"
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- transfer --from user --to user2 --amount 3
```

#### Clawback (Admin Only)

An admin can clawback a user's balance. The amount clawed back will be burned.

Using the admin, invoke the asset contract's `clawback` function.

```bash
stellar keys use admin
```

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- clawback --from user --amount 1
```

Check the balance after the clawback.

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id abc -- balance --id user
```
