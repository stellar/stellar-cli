You can use the Stellar CLI to extend the TTL of a contract's persistent storage entry. For a storage entry that uses a simple `Symbol` as its storage key, you can run a command like so:

```bash
stellar contract extend \
    --source S... \
    --network testnet \
    --id C... \
    --key COUNTER \
    --ledgers-to-extend 535679 \
    --durability persistent
```

This example uses 535,679 ledgers as the new archival TTL. This is the maximum allowable value for this argument on the CLI. This corresponds to roughly 30 days (averaging 5 second ledger close times).

If your storage entry uses a more advanced storage key, such as `Balance(Address)` in a token contract, you'll need to provide the key in a base64-encoded XDR form:

```bash
stellar contract extend \
    --source S... \
    --network testnet \
    --id C... \
    --key-xdr AAAABgAAAAHXkotywnA8z+r365/0701QSlWouXn8m0UOoshCtNHOYQAAAA4AAAAHQmFsYW5jZQAAAAAB \
    --ledgers-to-extend 535679 \
    --durability persistent
```
