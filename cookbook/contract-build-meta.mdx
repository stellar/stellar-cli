---

To build a smart contract, use the `stellar contract build` command. The `--meta` option will allow you to add additional meta data entries to the `contractmetav0` custom section of the resulting WASM file at build time.

```bash
stellar contract build \
    --manifest-path ./cmd/crates/soroban-test/tests/fixtures/test-wasms/hello_world/Cargo.toml \
    --meta one=two \
    --meta three=four
```

:::tip

You can use a tool like [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) to print out the text form of a WASM file, and see that your wasm file has the new meta data that you've added on build.

```bash cookbooktest.ignore
wasm-tools print target/wasm32v1-none/release/test_hello_world.wasm
```

Example truncated output:

```bash cookbooktest.ignore
(@custom "contractmetav0" (after data)
"\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\06cliver\00\00\00\00\00<23.1.4#v20.0.0-643-g52a86ecf1e11974b5f82a7b3b674b50a66ea1163\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\03one\00\00\00\00\03two\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\05three\00\00\00\00\00\00\04four")
)
```
