This guide walks you through generating, inspecting, and removing a Stellar identity using the CLI.

### 1. Generate a New Identity

Run the following command to create a new keypair and save it under the alias named `carol`:

```bash
stellar keys generate carol
```

Output:

```
✅ Key saved with alias carol in ".config/soroban/identity/carol.toml"
```

The CLI stores this identity in a TOML file.

### 2. Verify the Identity File

Navigate to the configuration directory and list the contents:

```bash
cd .config/soroban/identity && ls
```

Output:

```
carol.toml
```

The file carol.toml contains the seed phrase for your identity.

### 3. View the Seed Phrase

```
cat carol.toml
```

Output:

```
seed_phrase = "patrol clean public grocery roof aim have valve cherry dismiss lunar tail duty license capable little version banana amount often cover dice couple party"
```

Note: The seed phrase is sensitive information. Handle it with care and never expose it publicly.

### 4. Derive the Secret Key

To display the secret key for the carol identity:

```bash
stellar keys secret carol
```

Output:

```
SCJP663VYFZPYN75H2DYJA3FYUBP5UR23HZ4ZDHDMDY6TXVYUYMWNKTI
```

Note: The secret key is sensitive information. Handle it with care and never expose it publicly.

### 5. Derive the Public Key

To display the corresponding public key for the carol identity:

```bas
stellar keys public-key carol
```

Output:

```
GD3BFFX7DTNJAGDVVM5RYGGQQNURZTH4VSBLWF55YXY3L6T2WWZK57EI
```

This is the public address of your key.

### 6. Fund this account

```bash
stellar keys fund carol
```

Output:

```
✅ Account carol funded on "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

### 7. Remove the Identity

When you no longer need this identity, remove it using:

```
stellar keys rm carol
```

Output:

```
ℹ️  Removing the key's cli config file
```

At this point, the identity file carol.toml is deleted, and the alias is no longer available in the CLI.
