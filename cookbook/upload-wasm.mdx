To use the Stellar CLI to upload a compiled smart contract on the ledger, use the `stellar contract upload` command:

```bash
stellar contract upload \
    --source S... \
    --network testnet \
    --wasm ../relative/path/to/soroban_contract.wasm
```

:::note

Note this command will return the hash ID of the Wasm bytecode, rather than an address for a contract instance.
