### Working with Multisig

**Multisig Overview**  
Multisig accounts provide an additional layer of security by requiring multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. This feature is particularly useful for organizations or groups where multiple parties must agree before any funds can be moved.

---

#### Creating a Multisig Account

To create a multisig account on the Stellar ledger, use the `stellar account create` command with the desired thresholds. Here's how to do it:

```bash
stellar account create \
    --source S... \
    --network testnet \
    --threshold 2 \
    --signer S1...,S2...,S3...
```

**Parameters:**

- `--threshold`: The number of signatures required to authorize a transaction.
- `--signer`: The public keys of the signers involved in the multisig account.

:::note
Ensure that the total number of signers is greater than or equal to the threshold to allow successful transaction signing.

#### Signing Transactions with Multisig

Once you have a multisig account set up, you can sign transactions using the keys of the signers. Hereâ€™s an example of how to sign a transaction with multiple keys:

1. Create the transaction that requires multisig signing:

```bash
stellar transaction create \
    --source S... \
    --network testnet \
    --amount 10 \
    --destination D...
```

2. Sign the transaction with the required number of signers:

```bash
stellar transaction sign \
    --transaction [TRANSACTION_HASH] \
    --signer S1... \
    --network testnet
```

Repeat this step for each signer until you have the required number of signatures.

3. Submit the signed transaction:

```bash
stellar transaction submit \
    --transaction [TRANSACTION_HASH] \
    --network testnet
```
