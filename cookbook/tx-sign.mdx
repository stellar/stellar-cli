The previous examples of using `tx new` showed how to create transactions. However, these transactions were immediately ready to be signed and submitted to the network. 

To avoid this each of the subcommands has the `--build-only` argument, which as the name suggests only builds the transaction and prints the transaction envelope.

## `tx sign`

Let's return to the first example of creating `bob`s account:
  
  ```sh
stellar tx new create-account \
    --source alice \
    --destination bob \
    --starting-balance 100_000_000 \
    --build-only
  ```
  would output something like:
  
```sh
AAAAAgAAAADwSUp9CwmVlPN40mKX1I1j39y6DmYc36QS1aK2x6eYVQAAAGQAEcMsAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTMkzn1TwPo8SIhnKvnyuv9K2/aWjpX9NTYfyiA7vXaAAAAAAX14QAAAAAAAAAAAA==
```

You can inspect it with [stellar lab!](https://lab.stellar.org/xdr/view?$=network$id=testnet&label=Testnet&horizonUrl=https:////horizon-testnet.stellar.org&rpcUrl=https:////soroban-testnet.stellar.org&passphrase=Test%20SDF%20Network%20/;%20September%202015;&xdr$blob=AAAAAgAAAADwSUp9CwmVlPN40mKX1I1j39y6DmYc36QS1aK2x6eYVQAAAGQAEcMsAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTMkzn1TwPo8SIhnKvnyuv9K2//aWjpX9NTYfyiA7vXaAAAAAAX14QAAAAAAAAAAAA==;;) Where you can also sign and send the transaction.

However, you can also sign the transaction with the `tx sign` command. To do this you can pipe the output of the `tx new` command to the `tx sign` command:

```sh
stellar tx new create-account \
    --source alice \
    --destination bob \
    --starting-balance 100_000_000 \
    --build-only \
  | stellar tx sign --sign-with-key alice
```

This should output something like:

```sh
AAAAAgAAAADwSUp9CwmVlPN40mKX1I1j39y6DmYc36QS1aK2x6eYVQAAAGQAEcMsAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTMkzn1TwPo8SIhnKvnyuv9K2/aWjpX9NTYfyiA7vXaAAAAAAX14QAAAAAAAAAAAcenmFUAAABA2FCmaY4U8eFtqzJ1iEowvP1mashskYVxlqPjrM4miH0Q+QrF//A/NWflZPYzR+lySNrjJnRad851+4TbCekICw==
```
You can again [view it in lab and see that there is now a signature attached to the transaction envelope](AAAAAgAAAADwSUp9CwmVlPN40mKX1I1j39y6DmYc36QS1aK2x6eYVQAAAGQAEcMsAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTMkzn1TwPo8SIhnKvnyuv9K2/aWjpX9NTYfyiA7vXaAAAAAAX14QAAAAAAAAAAAcenmFUAAABA2FCmaY4U8eFtqzJ1iEowvP1mashskYVxlqPjrM4miH0Q+QrF//A/NWflZPYzR+lySNrjJnRad851+4TbCekICw==).

::tip
Or sign with lab! Though currently you must send it from lab and cannot return to the CLI (a work in progress!).
```sh
stellar tx new create-account \
    --source alice \
    --destination bob \
    --starting-balance 100_000_000 \
    --build-only \
  | stellar tx sign --sign-with-lab
```
:::

## `tx send`

Finally, to submit the transaction to the network you can use the `tx send` command. This command will submit the transaction to the network.

```sh
stellar tx new create-account \
    --source alice \
    --destination bob \
    --starting-balance 100_000_000 \
    --build-only \
  | stellar tx sign --sign-with-key alice \
  | stellar tx send
```
