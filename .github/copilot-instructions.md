# Stellar CLI Development Instructions

**Always follow these instructions first and fallback to additional search and context gathering only when the information here is incomplete or found to be in error.**

## Working Effectively

Stellar CLI is a Rust-based command-line tool for interacting with the Stellar network. It's organized as a Cargo workspace with multiple crates and uses both Cargo and Make for build automation.

### Bootstrap and Build
- Install system dependencies: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libudev-dev libdbus-1-dev build-essential`
- Install Rust toolchain: `rustup update` (Rust 1.89.0+ required)
- Add WebAssembly target: `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`
- Build main CLI: `cargo build --bin stellar` -- takes 45 seconds. NEVER CANCEL.
- Install CLI: `make install` -- takes 3 minutes with potential network timeouts. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 10+ minutes.

### Core Development Commands
- Format code: `make fmt` -- takes 2 seconds
- Run linting: `make check` -- takes 7 minutes. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 15+ minutes.
- Build main CLI only: `cargo build --bin stellar` -- takes 45 seconds. Use this for quick iterations.

### Testing
- Test main soroban-cli library: `cargo test --package soroban-cli --lib` -- takes 52 seconds. NEVER CANCEL.
- Test individual crates: `cargo test --package <crate-name>` -- typically takes 40 seconds per crate.
- **WARNING**: Full test suite via `make test` requires building WebAssembly test fixtures and consumes significant memory and disk space. It may fail with "No space left on device" in constrained environments.

### CLI Usage and Validation
- Test CLI installation: `stellar --version`
- Basic CLI validation: `stellar --help`
- Generate test keys: `stellar keys generate <name>`
- Get key address: `stellar keys address <name>`

## Validation

- **ALWAYS run basic validation after changes**: Build the CLI with `cargo build --bin stellar` and test basic functionality with `stellar --help`.
- **Core testing workflow**: Run `cargo test --package soroban-cli --lib` to validate core functionality.
- **Pre-commit validation**: Always run `make fmt` and `make check` before committing changes.
- **Memory considerations**: Full test suite may fail in constrained environments due to memory and disk space requirements.

└── .github/workflows/       # CI configuration
```

### Key Commands Reference
```bash
# Development workflow
cargo build --bin stellar        # Quick build (45s)
make install                     # Full install (3m, may timeout)
make fmt                         # Format code (2s)
make check                       # Lint code (7m)

# Testing
cargo test --package soroban-cli --lib  # Core tests (52s)
cargo test --package <crate>            # Individual crate tests (~40s)

# CLI validation
stellar --version               # Check installation
stellar --help                 # Verify functionality
stellar keys generate test     # Test key generation
stellar keys address test      # Test key operations
```

### Build Time Expectations
- **NEVER CANCEL** any build or test command before these timeouts:
  - `cargo build --bin stellar`: 2 minutes timeout minimum
  - `make install`: 10 minutes timeout (network issues common)
  - `make check`: 15 minutes timeout minimum
  - Individual crate tests: 5 minutes timeout minimum
  - Core library tests: 5 minutes timeout minimum

### Known Issues
- **Network timeouts**: `make install` frequently encounters network timeouts with crates.io. This is normal in CI environments.
- **Memory constraints**: Full workspace build and test may fail with OOM or "No space left on device" errors in constrained environments.
- **Documentation generation**: `make generate-full-help-doc` may fail due to disk space constraints.

### Working Around Constraints
- Use `cargo build --bin stellar` instead of full workspace build for development
- Test individual packages with `cargo test --package <name>` instead of full test suite
- Use `cargo install --force --locked --path ./cmd/stellar-cli` as alternative to `make install`

## Critical Warnings
- **NEVER CANCEL builds or tests** before the specified timeout periods
- **Always validate changes** by building and testing the CLI before committing
- **Network issues are common** - retry `make install` if it fails with timeouts
- **Use surgical builds** when possible to avoid memory/disk issues

## CI/CD Integration
The project uses GitHub Actions with workflows in `.github/workflows/`:
- `rust.yml`: Main CI pipeline with formatting, linting, building, and testing
- `e2e.yml`: End-to-end system tests
- `binaries.yml`: Multi-platform binary builds

Always run `make fmt` and `make check` locally before pushing to ensure CI passes.
